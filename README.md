Event-driven distributed systems in Go, with gRPC, NATS JetStream and CockroachDB
* Building distributed systems and Microservices in Go

## Technologies Used: 
* Go
* [NATS JetStream](/nats/README.md)
* gRPC
* [CockroachDB](/CockroachDB/README.md)
* Go kit
* Zipkin (for distributed tracing)

Notes:

event-driven architectures for building distributed systems, you donâ€™t follow Microservices architecture for building distributed systems, you may end with most of the difficulties which we have discussed in the preceding section.

Details:
- [NATS JetStream](/nats/README.md)
- [CockroachDB](/CockroachDB/README.md)
